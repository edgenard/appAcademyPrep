2.5 A few things to try
write a program that tells you the following
1. Hours in a year. How many hours are in a year?
2. Minutes in a decade. How many minutes are in a decade?
3. Your age in seconds. How many seconds old are you?
4. Our dear authors age if our dear author is 1.025 million seconds old

5.6 A few things to try
1. Full name greeting. Write a program that asks for a persons first name, 
then middle, and then last. It should greet the person using their full name.

2. Bigger, better favorite number. Write a program that asks for a peron's favorite
number. Have your pogram add 1 to the number and then suggest the result as a bigger
better favorite number.

6.2 A few things to try
1. Angry boss. Write an angry boss program that rudely asks what you want.
Whatever your answer the angry boss should yell it back to you and fire you.

2. Table of contents. Here's something for you to do in order to play around more
with center, ljust and rjust: write a program that will display a table of contents
so it looks like this:
                        Table of Contents
Chapter 1: Getting Started                            page 1
Chapter 2: Numbers                                    page 9
Chapter 3: Letters                                    page 13
=end

#Angry Boss and Table of Contents
# puts "Boss: What now?"
# request = gets.chomp
# puts "Me: What do you mean you want " +"'" + request + "' " + "?!"
# puts "Boss: Who do you think you are?!"
# puts "Me: I think I'm me"
# puts "Boss: You're fired!"
# puts "Me: Fine, I'm going to get a job making table of contents, I'll show you!"
# puts "Several months later Boss sees my picture on a bill board with this table of contents next to it: "
# line_width = 75

# puts "Boss: I was wrong. So so wrong!"
# puts "Boss weeps"

7.5 A few things to try
1. 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall. Write a program that prints out the lyrics to the beloved classic.

2. Deaf Grandma. Whatever you say (type in), she should respond with this:
HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY! unless you shout it(type it in all capitals). If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) and yells back:
NO NOT SINCE 1938!
To make your program really believable, have Grandma shout a different year each time, maybe any year at random between 
1930 and 1950. You can't stop talking to Grandma until you shout BYE.

3. Deaf grandma extended. What if Grandma doesn't want you to leave? When you shout BYE, she could pretend not to hear you.
Change your previous program so that you have to shout BYE three times in a row. Make sure to test your program: if you shout BYE
three times but not in a row, you should still be talking to Grandma. 

4. Leap years. Write a program that asks for a starting year and an ending year and then puts all the leap years
between them (and including them, if they are also leap years). Leap years are years divisible by 4. However, years divisible
by 100 are not leap years unless they are also divisible by 400.

8.3
1. Building and sorting an array. Write the program we talked about at the 
beginning of this chapter, one that asks us to type as many words as we want 
(one word per line, continuing until we just press Enter on an empty line) and 
then repeats the words back to us in alphabetical order. Make sure to test your
program thor- oughly; for example, does hitting Enter on an empty line always
exit your program? Even on the first line? And the second? Hint: There’s a 
lovely array method that will give you a sorted version of an array: sort. Use it!

2. Table of contents, revisited. Rewrite your table of contents program on 
page 36. Start the program with an array holding all of the information for 
your table of contents (chapter names, page numbers, and so on). Then print out
the information from the array in a beautifully formatted table of contents.

#9.5 A few things to try Improved ask method. That ask method I showed you was OK, but I bet you could do better. Try to clean it up by removing the answer variable. You’ll have to use return to exit from the loop. Well, it will get you out of the whole method,but it will get you out of the loop n the process. How do you like the resulting method? I usually try to avoid using return (a personal preference), but I might make an exception here.

#Old School Roman numerals.
=begin
In the early days of Roman numerals, the Romans didn’t bother with any of this 
new-fangled subtraction “IX” nonsense. No sir, it was straight addition, biggest 
to littlest—so 9 was written “VIIII,” and so on. Write a method that when passed an 
integer between 1 and 3000 (or so) returns a string containing the proper old-school 
Roman numeral. In other words, old_roman_numeral 4 should return 'IIII'. Make sure to 
test your method on a bunch of different numbers. Hint: Use the integer division and 
modulus methods on page 37.

  roman_array = [[1000, 'M'], [500, 'D'], [100, 'C'], [50, 'L'], [10, 'X'], 
  [5, 'V'], [1, 'I'],]
  roman_array.each do |value|
    count = number / value[0]
    roman_string = roman_string + (value[1] * count)
    number = number - (count * value[0])
  end
  return roman_string

=begin
“Modern” Roman numerals. Eventually, someone thought it would be terribly clever if putting a smaller number before a larger one meant you had to subtract the smaller one. As a result of this development, you must now suffer. Rewrite your previous method to return the new-style Roman numerals so when someone calls roman_numeral 4, it should return 'IV'
